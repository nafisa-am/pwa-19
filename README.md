# PWA-19

# Summary

In this challenge I was tasked with building a text editor that runs in the browser. This is a single page application that meets the PWA criteria. It features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as replacement in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. This application also functions offline.

### Description  

To build this text editor, you will start with an existing application and implement methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. You will use a package called `idb`, which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. It features a number of methods that are useful for storing and retrieving data, and is used by companies like Google and Mozilla.
